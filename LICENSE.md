Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Our licenses are intended to make copyrighted works freely available for non-commercial use by the public, and may be used by anyone for any non-commercial purpose. The licenses grant permission to use the copyrighted materials under specified terms and conditions. If you are considering using copyrighted material for commercial purposes, especially where a CC license does not grant that permission, you should consult a qualified lawyer first.
